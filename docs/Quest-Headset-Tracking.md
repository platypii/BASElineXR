# Learn how headset tracking works on Meta Quest 

Meta Quest headsets utilise inside-out tracking with 6DoF (six degrees of freedom). If you turn tracking off from the settings panel in your headset, you're actually switching from 6DoF tracking to 3DoF tracking. Each tracking type is explained in more detail below.

 - 3DoF: Three degrees of freedom (DoF) tracking can track rotational movements around the x, y and z axes. 3DoF only tracks the direction that you are looking in (e.g. up/down, left/right), but doesn't track position as you move around the room.
 - 6DoF: Six degrees of freedom (DoF) tracking adds the ability to track positional movement. With 6DoF, your headset will track the direction you are looking in (as with 3DoF), and also your position as you walk around the room.

Here's a simple test to see what kind of tracking you have enabled in your headset: If you can move closer to or further from an object, that means that you're using 6DoF tracking. If you can only look around and not actually move towards anything, you're using 3DoF tracking.

## Turn tracking on or off

By default, your headset will use 6DoF tracking unless you've turned it off or your headset lost tracking during use.

To turn headset tracking on or off:

 1. Press Meta button or Oculus button on your right Touch controller to open the Navigator.
 2. On the right, select Quick controls.
 3. Select Settings, then select Movement tracking.
 4. Select the toggle next to Headset tracking to turn this feature on or off.

## Optimal tracking conditions

In order for the tracking on your headset to work best, your playing space should have bright, even lighting. As a general recommendation, you'll want to have the same amount of light as you would have in the living room when you have guests over. If the lighting in your room is too dark, your headset may lose the ability to use 6DoF tracking.

## The purpose of 6DoF tracking

6DoF tracking allows the movements you make in the real world to translate into your headset. As a result, many apps, games and experiences require 6DoF tracking to function. This includes the boundaries designed to help you stay in your play space while you're using your headset.

To help avoid injury or damage, you should only use your Meta Quest headset in a stationary, standing or seated position if you turn off 6DoF tracking.

## What to do if tracking is lost

When 6DoF tracking is unable to function in your environment, you'll receive an error message to alert you that tracking has been lost. You can choose to continue using your headset with 3DoF tracking, or you can try the following steps to re-enable your headset's 6DoF tracking.

 - Check your environment: If you need to adjust your environment so that tracking can resume, remove your headset and check to make sure that the lighting in the room hasn't changed. If it has, try turning on additional lights or relocating to a more well-lit room.
 - Clear your boundary history: If you're having problems with tracking, clearing your boundary history can often fix the issue. Bear in mind that if you have multiple profiles on the same headset, boundary history will be cleared for all profiles, not just the profile you're currently using. You can clear your history from [boundary settings](https://www.meta.com/en-us/help/quest/463504908043519/). 
 - Note: If you clear your history, you'll need to re-draw your boundaries.

Once you've gone through the steps above to fix the issue that caused the tracking loss, follow the steps for Turning tracking on to turn on 6DoF tracking on your headset.
